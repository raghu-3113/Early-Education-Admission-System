# Early-Education-Admission-System
Industry-guided academic project for automating preschool admissions


# 📌 Overview
The Early Education Admission System (EEAS) is a web-based application designed to automate and simplify the preschool admission process. It enables parents to access preschool information, schedule visits, and submit enrollment applications online, while allowing administrators to efficiently manage admissions and related activities through a centralized system.


# 🎯 Project Context
Project Type: Academic / Industry-Guided Project
Degree: B.Tech – Artificial Intelligence & Data Science
University: JNTU Hyderabad

This project was completed as part of the B.Tech academic curriculum.
The project framework and guidance were provided externally, with emphasis on studying, understanding, executing, and analyzing a complete web-based admission system.


#🧠 Core Idea
The core idea of EEAS is to replace manual, paper-based preschool admissions with a centralized, online platform that improves accessibility for parents and operational efficiency for school administrators.
